# Development and Validation of a Transformer Electronic Laryngoscope Deep Learning Model for Diagnosis of Vocal Cord Lesions
> **Paper**: Development and Validation of a Transformer Electronic Laryngoscope Deep Learning Model for Diagnosis of Vocal Cord Lesions  
This repository provides **complete reproduction code** of the model described in the paper, covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation and visualization. The goal is to help researchers and clinical engineers quickly build, verify and expand the automatic diagnosis system of vocal cord lesions.
